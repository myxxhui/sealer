has two top module: Build Engine &amp; Apply Engine\nThe Build Engine Using Kubefile and build context as Input, and build a CloudImage that contains all the dependencies.\nThe Apply Engine Using Clusterfile to Init a cluster witch contains kubernetes and other applications.\nBuild Engine\n\nParser : parse Kubefile into image metadata\nRegistry : push or pull the CloudImage\nStore : save CloudImage to local disks\n\nBuilders\n\nLite Builder, sealer will check all the manifest or helm chart, decode docker images in those files, and cache then into CloudImage\nCloud Builder, sealer will create a Cluster using public cloud, and exec RUN &amp; CMD command witch defined in Kubefile, then cache all the docker image in the Cluster.\nContainer Builder, Using Docker container as a node, run kubernetes cluster in container then cache all the docker images\n\nApply Engine\n\nInfra : manage infrastructure, like create VMs in public cloud then apply the cluster on top of it. Or using docker emulation nodes.\nRuntime : cluster installer implementation, like using kubeadm to installl cluster.\nConfig : application config, like mysql username passwd or other configs, you can using Config overwrite any file you want.\nPlugin : plugin help us do some extra work, like exec a shell command before install, or add a label to a node after install.\nDebug : help us check the cluster is helth or not, found reason when things unexpected.\n\nOther modules\n\nFilesystem : Copy CloudRootfs files to all nodes\nMount : mount CloudImage all layers together\nChecker : do some precheck and post check\nCommand : a command proxy to do some task witch os don't have the command. Like ipvs or cert manager.\nGuest : manage user application layer, like exec CMD command defined in Kubefile.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/arch/","title":"Architecture"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/arm/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/arm/","title":"ARM CloudImage"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/cloudrootfs/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/cloudrootfs/","title":"Define you own CloudRootfs"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/containerd/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/containerd/","title":"Containerd BaseImage"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/gpu/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/advanced/gpu/","title":"GPU supported"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/","title":"Contributing"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/","title":"Code of conduct"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/":{"body":"Contributing\n👉 Make sure to read the Code of Conduct.\nContribute to Doks\n👉 The AdiDoks code lives in the adidoks repository\n\nFollow the GitHub flow.\nFollow the Conventional Commits Specification\n\nCreate an issue\n\nBug report\nFeature request\n\nImprove documentation\n👉 The documentation lives in ./content/docs/\nof the adidoks repository.\n\nFollow the GitHub flow.\nFollow the Conventional Commits Specification\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/contributing/how-to-contribute/","title":"How to Contribute"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/getting-started/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/docs/getting-started/applications/":{"body":"Requirements\nBefore using the theme, you need to install the Zola ≥ 0.13.0.\nRun the Theme Directly\ngit clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git\ncd adidoks\nzola serve\n\nVisit http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser.\nInstallation\nJust earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly.
